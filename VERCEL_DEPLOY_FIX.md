# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Problem
The 404 error occurred because:
1. You were deploying from the root directory
2. The Next.js app is in the `dashboard_nextjs` subdirectory
3. Vercel couldn't find the Next.js application

## The Solution
I've created a `vercel.json` configuration file in the root that tells Vercel:
- Where to find the Next.js app (`dashboard_nextjs` folder)
- How to build it
- Where to install dependencies

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Deploy from Root (Recommended)
```bash
# From the root directory (mhxdrug)
git add vercel.json dashboard_nextjs/next.config.js
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push

# Then redeploy on Vercel (it will auto-deploy if connected to git)
# Or manually: vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Deploy from Subdirectory
```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard directory
cd dashboard_nextjs

# Deploy directly
vercel --prod
```

## What Changed
1. **Created `/vercel.json`** - Tells Vercel to build from the `dashboard_nextjs` subdirectory
2. **Updated `/dashboard_nextjs/next.config.js`** - Removed `output: 'standalone'` which is not needed for Vercel

## Verify Your Deployment
After deploying, the following should work:
- Homepage: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
- Data files: `https://your-app.vercel.app/data/summary.json`

## Troubleshooting
If you still get 404 errors:
1. Check the Vercel build logs for errors
2. Ensure all data files are in `dashboard_nextjs/public/data/`
3. Make sure `package.json` has all dependencies
4. Try a fresh deployment: `vercel --prod --force`
