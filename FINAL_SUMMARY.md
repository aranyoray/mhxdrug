## 📝 Analysis Recommendations

### **Complete Case Analysis**
For most robust analysis, use observations with complete socioeconomic data:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('county_year_merged.csv')

# Keep rows with complete SES controls
complete_ses = df.dropna(subset=[
    'UnemploymentRate', 'PovertyRate', 'MedianIncome',
    'PerCapitaIncome', 'RepublicanMargin',
    'BachelorsOrHigher', 'Population'
])
# ~90% of data retained (18,000+ observations)
```

### **Drug Death Analysis**
```python
# Observations with drug death data + controls
drug_analysis = df.dropna(subset=[
    'DrugDeaths', 'UnemploymentRate', 'PovertyRate',
    'RepublicanMargin', 'Population'
])
# ~45% of data (~9,000 observations)
```

### **Handling Missing CDC Data**

**Why data is missing:**
- CDC suppresses counts <10 for privacy
- Rates marked "Unreliable" when based on <20 deaths
- Primarily affects small/rural counties

**Options:**
1. **Complete case analysis** - Use only counties with reported data
2. **Sensitivity analysis** - Compare results with/without small counties
3. **Multiple imputation** - Use MICE or missForest
4. **Spatial models** - Borrow strength from neighboring counties
5. **Bounded imputation** - Assume suppressed values are in range [1, 9]

## 🔬 Potential Research Questions

### 1. **Political Polarization & Health Outcomes**
- Do drug deaths/suicides differ by political lean?
- Controlling for SES, does Republican margin predict outcomes?

### 2. **Socioeconomic Determinants**
- Impact of unemployment, poverty, income on mortality
- Education as protective factor
- Rent burden and mental health

### 3. **Demographic Patterns**
- Racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes
- Urban vs. rural differences (via population)
- Regional trends over time (2018-2023)

### 4. **Temporal Trends**
- COVID-19 impact (2020-2023 vs. 2018-2019)
- Political shifts (2016 election → 2020 election)
- Economic shocks (unemployment spikes in 2020)

---

## 📦 Optional: Add Employment Data (QCEW)

To add detailed employment and wage data:

```python
from merge_ses import merge_all
merge_all(skip_qcew=False)
```

**Warning**: Takes 10-15 minutes (~3GB download)

**Adds**:
- TotalEmployment
- AvgAnnualPay
