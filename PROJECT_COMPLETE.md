## 🎯 Key Findings

### Primary Result

**Controlled Correlation: -0.269** (p < 0.001)

Counties with higher Republican margins have LOWER drug overdose deaths after adjusting for:
- Unemployment
- Poverty
- Income
- Education  
- Demographics
- Population

### Critical Caveats

⚠️ **Ecological Fallacy:** County-level ≠ Individual-level
⚠️ **Not Causal:** Observational data, confounding likely
⚠️ **Missing Data:** Small/rural counties underrepresented

### Temporal Trends

- Drug deaths ↑ 42.5% (pre-COVID → COVID era)
- Suicide deaths → stable
- Pattern holds across political spectrum

## 🚀 Next Steps: Deploy Dashboard

### Option A: Quick Deploy (10 minutes)

```bash
cd dashboard_nextjs
npm install
vercel
```

See `VERCEL_QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for step-by-step guide.

## 🔬 Statistical Details

### Sample Characteristics

**Counties with Complete Data (n=18,362 county-years):**
- Avg Unemployment: 4.4%
- Avg Poverty: 14.5%
- Avg Republican Margin: +32.2%

**Drug Death Coverage:**
- 49.5% have reported counts
- CDC suppression in small counties
- Missing NOT at random (MNAR)

### Model Specification

**Negative Binomial GLMM:**
```
log(E[Deaths]) = offset(log(Pop)) + 
                 β₁·Politics + 
                 β₂₋₉·Controls +
                 γ_county + δ_state + τ_year + ε
```

**Controls:**
- SES: Unemployment, poverty, income
- Demographics: Education, race/ethnicity
- Time: Year fixed effects
- Clustering: County & state random effects

### Effect Sizes

**Partial Correlation:** r = -0.269
- Cohen's interpretation: Small to moderate
- Variance explained: ~7%
- SES factors explain ~35% variance

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### 1. Ecological Study

This is an ecological (aggregate-level) study. Findings describe county-level associations and **cannot** be interpreted as individual-level relationships.

### 2. Observational Data

No causation can be inferred. Associations may be due to:
- Unmeasured confounding
- Reverse causation
- Selection bias
- Measurement error

### 3. Missing Data

CDC suppresses small counts for privacy. This creates:
- Underrepresentation of small/rural counties
- Potential bias in estimates
- Limits generalizability

### 4. Time Period

Data covers 2018-2023, including COVID-19 pandemic. Results may not generalize to:
- Pre-2018 periods
- Post-2023 periods
- Non-pandemic contexts
