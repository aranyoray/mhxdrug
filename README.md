**Mental Health, Drug Deaths & Political Orientation Dashboard**

Interactive county-level analysis of the relationships between political lean, drug overdose mortality, suicide deaths, and socioeconomic factors across U.S. counties (2018-2023).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project integrates health outcomes, political data, and socioeconomic indicators to explore county-level patterns in drug overdose and suicide mortality. All analyses control for confounding factors using rigorous statistical methods.

### Key Finding

**Controlled Correlation: -0.269 (p < 0.001)**

Counties with higher Republican vote margins have LOWER drug overdose deaths after controlling for unemployment, poverty, income, education, and demographics.

**Critical Caveat:** This is an ecological (county-level) association. Individual-level inferences cannot be made from this data.

## 📊 Dataset

- **20,201 observations** (3,373 counties × 6 years)
- **20 variables** (health, SES, politics, demographics)
- **Coverage:** 2018-2023
- **Completeness:** 90%+ for SES data, 50% for health outcomes (CDC privacy suppression)

### Variables

**Health Outcomes:**
- Drug overdose deaths & rates (CDC WONDER)
- Suicide deaths & rates (CDC WONDER)

**Political:**
- Republican/Democrat vote shares (MIT Election Lab)
- Republican margin (interpolated 2016-2024)

**Socioeconomic:**
- Unemployment rate (USDA ERS)
- Poverty rate (Census SAIPE)
- Median household income (Census SAIPE)
- Per capita income (BEA)
- Rent (Zillow ZORI)

**Demographics:**
- Education (% Bachelor's+)
- Race/ethnicity (% White, Black, Hispanic/Latino)
- Population (Census ACS)

## 📈 Statistical Models

### Negative Binomial GLMM

```
log(E[Deaths]) = offset(log(Pop)) +
                 β₁·RepublicanMargin +
                 β₂₋₉·(SES + Demographics) +
                 γ_county + δ_state + τ_year + ε
```

**Results:**
- RepublicanMargin coefficient: -0.0071 (p < 0.0001)
- Interpretation: 10-point increase in Republican margin associated with ~7% decrease in expected drug deaths (holding all else constant)

### Two-Way ANOVA

Time Period (Pre-COVID vs. COVID) × Political Lean (Democrat/Swing/Republican)
- Significant main effects for both factors
- No significant interaction

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

1. **Ecological Fallacy:** County-level patterns ≠ individual-level relationships
2. **Observational Data:** No causal inference possible
3. **Missing Data:** CDC suppresses counts <10 for privacy (affects small/rural counties)
4. **Confounding:** Unmeasured variables (healthcare access, drug supply, etc.)
5. **Time Period:** Includes COVID-19 pandemic (may not generalize)
